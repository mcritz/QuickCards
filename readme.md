# Quick Cards
## Simple, Stupid, Probably Wrong

A means to create some simple user testing card sorts based on JSON datda.

## Usage

1. Populate the data/data.json with a few arrays of html.
2. Open index.html from a server of your choosing.

On my Mac I turn on apache and host from /Library/WebServer/Documents
Also tested with Node.js and Rails.
